     * This is the Liquid template that must return exactly "true" or "false" as a string.
     * The template is evaluated and the entire output must be either "true" or "false" - nothing else.
     *
     * Available variables:
     * - `messages`: Array of recent messages in OpenAI chat completions format (ChatCompletionMessageParam[])
     *   Each message has properties like: role ('user', 'assistant', 'system'), content (string), etc.
     * - `now`: Current timestamp in milliseconds (built-in Liquid variable)
     * - Any assistant variable values (e.g., `userName`, `accountStatus`)
     *
     * Useful Liquid filters for messages:
     * - `messages | last: 5` - Get the 5 most recent messages
     * - `messages | where: 'role', 'user'` - Filter to only user messages
     * - `messages | reverse` - Reverse the order of messages
