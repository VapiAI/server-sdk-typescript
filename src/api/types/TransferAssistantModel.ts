     * **Add Context:** You can provide additional messages (user, assistant, etc.) to add context while keeping the default system message, or combine them with your custom system message.

     * **Default Behavior:** The transfer assistant will ALWAYS have both `transferSuccessful` and `transferCancel` tools automatically added, regardless of what you provide here.
     *
     * **Default Tools:**
     * - `transferSuccessful`: "Call this function to confirm the transfer is successful and connect the customer. Use this when you detect a human has answered and is ready to take the call."
     * - `transferCancel`: "Call this function to cancel the transfer when no human answers or transfer should not proceed. Use this when you detect voicemail, busy signal, or no answer."
     *
     * **Customization:** You can override the default tools by providing `transferSuccessful` and/or `transferCancel` tools with custom `function` or `messages` configurations.
     *
     * **Additional Tools:** You can also provide other tools, but the two transfer tools will always be present and available to the assistant.
